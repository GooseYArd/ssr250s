A while back, I bought one of my kids an SSR SR70C dirt bike. I was
so impressed with the little bike that later, when I was looking
for a used 250 to ride with my kids, I decided to take a chance on
SSR's larger machine, the SR250C.

Information about these bikes is somewhat hard to come by;
despite their low price, and although the pit bikes seem to sell
pretty well, I'm only spoken to a couple of other SR250S owners.

I expect to get a lot details wrong on this page and I count on
readers who know more than I do to set me straight. Please, if you
have corrections or additional information for the page, email it to
me at [gooseyard@gmail.com](mailto:gooseyard@gmail.com "gooseyard@gmail.com").

Overview
========

The NC250 is manufactured by
[Shandong Asiawing Motors Co.,Ltd.](http://asiawing.com/) (their
website appears to be down at the moment I am writing this). It is
distributed to other countries around the world by other importers.
In the United States, the bike is imported by SSR Motorsports and is
known as the SR250S.

In Europe, [Borossi](http://www.borossi.com/Asiawing-Enduro-SuperMoto/)
distributes the bikes, now under the Asiawing brand.

The SR250S is patterned on the 2007 model year CRF250X. In most
cases, parts for that bike will fit the SR250S.


Engine
======

The NC250/SR250S engine is a
[Zongshen ZS177MM](http://www.zse.cc/productsdetail.aspx?ProductsCateId=43&ProductsID=386),
manufactured by [Chongqing Zongshen Power Machinery Company (宗申)](http://en.zongshenmotor.com/).

This engine is also used in a number of other Chinese
motorcycles and scooters, perhaps most notably the Zongshen RX-3
adventure-touring bike, which is distributed in the United States
by the [California Scooter Company](http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/)


ZS177MM Parts
-------------

When searching online for SR250S parts, it is helpful to use
"NC250" rather than "SR250S", since the bike is called NC250
everywhere except the US.

Parts for this motor are plentiful and relatively cheap if you don't
mind having them shipped from abroad.

Another option is to purchase parts from CSC for the RX-3:

Carburetor
==========

The NC250 carburetor is manufactured by
[Sunworld Moto](http://www.sunworld.com.tw/en/main/)">. Mine has
the marking *SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34*.

[![Picture of SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34 Carburetor](small_carb.jpg)](carb.jpg)

I sent an inquiry to a representative at Sunworld Moto about the
availability of a jet kit for this carb. Sunworld replied
immediately that this carb is made exclusively for the NC250, and
that my distributor would handle parts for it. I spoke to a
representative at SSR, who informed me that a jet kit for a CRF250X
would fit the SWR carb, but I have yet to try this.

Carb Settings
-------------

From the dealer, the factory setting for the air screw was the
standard 2 turns.

Fuel
----

When I got the bike, it had a full tank of 87 octane pump gas. The
bike ran terribly. When hot, it would not idle with two turns on the
air screw. If I adjusted the air screw such that the bike would idle
when hot, it would not start cold, and ran very roughly.  Starting the
bike on 87 octane gas was also frustrating, requiring 8 or 10 seconds
to start.

After studying the Zongshen and Asiawing manuals, it was clear that I
should be using higher octane fuel. After draining and refilling the
tank with 93 octane pump gas and setting the air screw back to two
turns, the bike starts immediately and runs flawlessly. I didn't
notice audible pinging with the 87 octane gas, but I did get a lot of
stuttering above 1/4 throttle, which I don't get with 93.


Exhaust
=======

The stock exhaust on the NC250 has the appearance of an aftermarket
pipe, is fairly light (TKTKg), but lacks an internal spark
arrestor.


Suspension
==========
According to Borossi, rear suspension is "rear pergressive FastAce
Performance mono shock absorber with spring preload and rebound and
compression damping" (sic).

I took my rear shock to my local RaceTech dealer,
[MRP Motorsports](https://www.mrpmotorsports.com/), and had the
factory spring rated. The stock spring is 270mm in length, with 58mm
and 60mm ID on the top and bottom ends, respectively. The rate is
6.1kg/mm, which differs considerably from 2007 CRF250X rate of
4.8kg/mm according to
[Racetech](http://www.racetech.com/ProductSearch/1/Honda/CRF250X/2007).

At 250lb, I've resprung mine with a 66 N/mm &Ouml;hlins spring (06310-17),
which &Ouml;hlins lists as a KYB replacement spring. [More Spring Rates](http://www.ohlins.uk.com/ohlins-mx-spring-kits.html).

Also according to Borossi, the front suspension is an 47mm
Upside-Down FastAce Performance fork; rebound and compression
adjustable.

The rear shock fairly easily using
[this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvkLxjvcwA), which
involves removing the pipe and unbolting the subframe, without having
to remove the airbox. I recommend loosening the pipe clamp by the carb
outlet, and have some (I used zip ties) to support the subframe while
the shock is out.


Handlebars and Risers
=====================

[![Picture of SSR SR250S triple clamp](small_handlebar.jpg)](handlebar.jpg)

The stock handle bar tapers from 1.125" to 0.875" (1 1/8 to 7/8)

I'm tall with a long torso so I like bar risers if I'm standing on the
pegs a lot. I think I'll add some to this bike, but haven't yet.


Shifter
=======

[![Picture of SSR SR250S shifter](small_shifter.jpg)](shifter.jpg)

The shifter is of the folding design, similar to the CRF250X
pattern, but I haven't compared them.

Length is about 5" from the front edge to the center line of the
shifter shaft, which I measured as 0.425" (10.8mm?). I crudely
measured this without detaching the shifter. If you are looking for
this measurement let me know, I'll take it off and get a more
accurate measure.


Other Parts
===========

[TBolt USA](http://tboltusa.com/store/full-size-dirt-bikes-c-520.html)
carries levers and misc parts. They're helpful on the forums so I plan
to buy from them when I can.
