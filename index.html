<p>A while back, I bought one of my kids an SSR SR70C dirt bike. I was so impressed with the little bike that later, when I was looking for a used 250 to ride with my kids, I decided to take a chance on SSR's larger machine, the SR250C.</p>
<p><a href="bike.jpg"><img src="small_bike.jpg" alt="Picture of the SSR SR250S" /></a></p>
<p>Information about these bikes is somewhat hard to come by; despite their low price, and although the pit bikes seem to sell pretty well, I'm only spoken to a couple of other SR250S owners.</p>
<p>I expect to get a lot details wrong on this page and I count on readers who know more than I do to set me straight. Please, if you have corrections or additional information for the page, email it to me at <script type="text/javascript">

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The NC250 is manufactured by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/asiawingmotors/?fref=ts">Shandong Asiawing Motors Co.,Ltd.</a> (their website appears to be down at the moment I am writing this). It is distributed to other countries around the world by other importers. In the United States, the bike is imported by SSR Motorsports and is known as the SR250S.</p>
<p>In Europe, <a href="http://www.borossi.com/Asiawing-Enduro-SuperMoto/">Borossi</a> distributes the bikes, now under the Asiawing brand.</p>
<p>In Australia, the bike is distributed by <a href="http://crossfiremotorcycles.com/">Crossfire</a> as the <a href="http://crossfiremotorcycles.com/product/xz250rr/">XZ250RR</a>.</p>
<p>The SR250S is patterned on the 2007 model year CRF250X. In most cases, parts for that bike will fit the SR250S.</p>
<h1 id="parts-compatibility">Parts Compatibility</h1>
<p>Crossfire, who for some time imported the NC250 into Australia as the XZ250R and XZ250RR, published <a href="XZ250RR_Compatible_Parts_With_Honda_CRF250_and_Honda_CRF450.pdf">this PDF</a>, which lists parts compatibility between their bike and the CRF 250/450. I have reformatted the table for the browser and removed the untranslated chinese.</p>
<p>A <a href="XZ250RPartsManual.pdf">parts diagram</a> is also available.</p>
<p>I have not verified any of this information, so use at your own risk.</p>

<h1 id="engine">Engine</h1>
<p>The NC250/SR250S engine is a <a href="http://www.zse.cc/productsdetail.aspx?ProductsCateId=43&amp;ProductsID=386">Zongshen ZS177MM</a>, manufactured by <a href="http://en.zongshenmotor.com/">Chongqing Zongshen Power Machinery Company (宗申)</a>.</p>
<p>This engine is also used in a number of other Chinese motorcycles and scooters, perhaps most notably the Zongshen RX-3 adventure-touring bike, which is distributed in the United States by the <a href="http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/">California Scooter Company</a></p>
<p>The ZS177M is definitely not a clone of the CRF250 engine, at least not when it comes to service parts like filters.</p>
<h2 id="zs177mm-parts">ZS177MM Parts</h2>
<p>When searching online for SR250S parts, it is helpful to use &quot;NC250&quot; rather than &quot;SR250S&quot;, since the bike is called NC250 everywhere except the US.</p>
<p>Crossfire published this <a href="XZ250RR-Engine-Parts.pdf">parts diagram</a> for the ZS177MM.</p>
<p>Parts for this motor are plentiful and relatively cheap if you don't mind having them shipped from abroad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/NC250-Parts/207293_251843072.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/NC250-Parts/207293_251843072.html</a></p>
<p>Another option is to purchase parts from CSC for the RX-3: <a href="http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/OEM-ENGINE-COMPONENTS-s/239.htm">http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/OEM-ENGINE-COMPONENTS-s/239.htm</a></p>
<h2 id="oil-filter">Oil Filter</h2>
<p>The oil filter included with the bike is a serviceable screen-type filter, not a pleated paper filter. When changing the engine oil, you can remove the filter, slide the core out of the screen, and use a solvent and bristle brush to clean the screen. I used compressed air to blow out any bits from the screen.</p>
<p>Although I neglected to get a photo of it, I gave the bike an initial oil change after about 6-8 hours of riding, since many forum trolls had claimed the filter would be full of shavings as the engine inevitably destroyed itself after a few hours of use. I found virtually nothing, a few very fine bits (which I think might've been from the filter screen itself), and a little bit of ferrous gunk on the oil drain plug magnet, about what I've seen on any brand new motorcycle.</p>
<p>I'm going to stick with the serviceable filter for now, although I think that CSC RX-3 pleated paper filters will fit this motor. I will be interested to hear if anyone tries it.</p>
<p>By the way, my oil drain plug was sealed with gray hi-temp RTV rather than a crush washer, although I used a crush washer instead of more RTV when I made the first oil change.</p>
<h1 id="carburetor">Carburetor</h1>
<p>The NC250 carburetor is manufactured by <a href="http://www.sunworld.com.tw/en/main/">Sunworld Moto</a>. Mine has the marking <em>SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34</em>.</p>
<p><a href="carb.jpg"><img src="small_carb.jpg" alt="Picture of SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34 Carburetor" /></a></p>
<p>I sent an inquiry to a representative at Sunworld Moto about the availability of a jet kit for this carb. Sunworld replied immediately that this carb is made exclusively for the NC250, and that my distributor would handle parts for it. I spoke to a representative at SSR, who informed me that a jet kit for a CRF250X would fit the SWR carb, but I have yet to try this.</p>
<h2 id="carb-settings">Carb Settings</h2>
<p>From the dealer, the factory setting for the air screw was the standard 2 turns.</p>
<h2 id="fuel">Fuel</h2>
<p>The Zongshen and Asiawing manuals recommend 91 or higher octane fuel. I've been using 93 so far.</p>
<h1 id="exhaust">Exhaust</h1>
<p>The stock exhaust on the NC250 has the appearance of an aftermarket pipe, is fairly light (TKTKg), but lacks an internal spark arrestor.</p>
<p>I've ordered a <a href="http://lexx.com.au/honda/exhaust-pipe-slip-on-honda-crf250r-04-05-crf250x-04-11-crf-250">Lexx Slip-on Exhaust</a> but haven't received it yet, I'll update the site when I'm sure that it fits correctly. Several people recommended the FMF PowerCore 4, but it's about 100$ more than the Lexx.</p>
<h1 id="suspension">Suspension</h1>
<p>According to Borossi, rear suspension is &quot;rear pergressive FastAce Performance mono shock absorber with spring preload and rebound and compression damping&quot; (sic).</p>
<p>I took my rear shock to my local RaceTech dealer, <a href="https://www.mrpmotorsports.com/">MRP Motorsports</a>, and had the factory spring rated. The stock spring is 270mm in length, with 58mm and 60mm ID on the top and bottom ends, respectively. The rate is 6.1kg/mm, which differs considerably from 2007 CRF250X rate of 4.8kg/mm according to <a href="http://www.racetech.com/ProductSearch/1/Honda/CRF250X/2007">Racetech</a>.</p>
<p>At 250lb, I've resprung mine with a 66 N/mm Öhlins spring (06310-17), which Öhlins lists as a KYB replacement spring. <a href="http://www.ohlins.uk.com/ohlins-mx-spring-kits.html">More Spring Rates</a>.</p>
<p>Also according to Borossi, the front suspension is an 47mm Upside-Down FastAce Performance fork; rebound and compression adjustable.</p>
<p>The rear shock fairly easily using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvkLxjvcwA">this method</a>, which involves removing the pipe and unbolting the subframe, without having to remove the airbox. I recommend loosening the pipe clamp by the carb outlet, and have some (I used zip ties) to support the subframe while the shock is out.</p>
<h1 id="handlebars-and-risers">Handlebars and Risers</h1>
<p><a href="handlebar.jpg"><img src="small_handlebar.jpg" alt="Picture of SSR SR250S triple clamp" /></a></p>
<p>The stock handle bar tapers from 1.125&quot; to 0.875&quot; (1 1/8 to 7/8)</p>
<p>I'm tall with a long torso so I like bar risers if I'm standing on the pegs a lot. I think I'll add some to this bike, but haven't yet.</p>
<h1 id="shifter">Shifter</h1>
<p><a href="shifter.jpg"><img src="small_shifter.jpg" alt="Picture of SSR SR250S shifter" /></a></p>
<p>The shifter is of the folding design, similar to the CRF250X pattern, but I haven't compared them.</p>
<p>Length is about 5&quot; from the front edge to the center line of the shifter shaft, which I measured as 0.425&quot; (10.8mm?). I crudely measured this without detaching the shifter. If you are looking for this measurement let me know, I'll take it off and get a more accurate measure.</p>
<h1 id="plastics">Plastics</h1>
<p>I haven't determined whether the SR250S plastics are a match with the CRF, but I've got a couple of photos that might prove useful:</p>
<p><a href="front_fender.jpg"><img src="small_front_fender.jpg" alt="Picture of the SSR SR250S Front Fender" /></a></p>
