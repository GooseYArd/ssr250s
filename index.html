    <h1>GooseYArd's SSR SR250S/Asiawing NC250 Information Page</h1>

    A while back, I bought one of my kids an SSR SR70C dirt bike. I was so
    impressed with the little bike that later, when I was looking for a
    used 250 to ride with my kids, I decided to take a chance on SSR's
    larger machine, the SR250C.<P>

      <IMG SRC="small_bike.jpg"><P>
      
      Information about these bikes is somewhat hard to come by; despite
      their low price, and although the pit bikes seem to sell pretty
      well, I'm the only person I know who actually owns an SR250S<P>

      I expect to get a lot details wrong on this page and I count on
      readers who know more than I do to set me straight. Please, if you
      have corrections or additional information for the page, email it
      to me at <a href="mailto:gooseyard@gmail.com?Subject=NC250_page" target="_top">gooseyard@gmail.com</a>.<P>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      The NC250 is manufactured by <A HREF="http://asiawing.com/">Shandong Asiawing Motors Co.,Ltd. </A>(their website appears to be down at the moment I am writing this). It is
      distributed to other countries around the world by other importers. In
      the United States, the bike is imported by SSR Motorsports and is known as the SR250S.<P>

      In
      Europe, <A HREF="http://www.borossi.com/Asiawing-Enduro-SuperMoto/">Borossi</A>
      distributes the bikes, now under the Asiawing brand.<P>

      The SR250S is patterned on the 2007 model year CRF250X. In most cases,
      parts for that bike will fit the SR250S.<P>

      <h2>Engine</h2>

      The NC250/SR250S engine is
      a <A HREF="http://www.zse.cc/productsdetail.aspx?ProductsCateId=43&ProductsID=386">Zongshen
        ZS177MM</A><P>

      This engine is also used in a number of other Chinese motorcycles and
      scooters, perhaps most notably the Zongshen RX-3 adventure-touring
      bike, which is distributed in the United States by the <A HREF="http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/">California
        Scooter Company</A>.<P>

      <h3>ZS177MM Parts</h3>

      When searching online for SR250S parts, it is helpful to use "NC250"
      rather than "SR250S", since the bike is called NC250 everywhere except
      the US.<P>

      Parts for this motor are plentiful and relatively cheap if you don't
      mind having them shipped from abroad. <P>

      Another option is to purchase parts from CSC for the RX-3:<P>

      <h2>Carburetor</h2>

      The NC250 carburetor is manufactured
      by <A HREF="http://www.sunworld.com.tw/en/main/">Sunworld
        Moto</A>. Mine has the marking <I>SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34</I>.<P>

      <A HREF="carb.jpg"><IMG SRC="small_carb.jpg"></A><P>

              
      I sent an inquiry to a representative at Sunworld Moto about the
      availability of a jet kit for this carb. Sunworld replied immediately
      that this carb is made exclusively for the NC250, and that my
      distributor would handle parts for it. I spoke to a representative at
      SSR, who informed me that a jet kit for a CRF250X would fit the SWR
      carb, but I have yet to try this.<P>

      <h3>Settings</h3>

      From the dealer, the factory setting for the air screw was the standard 2 turns.<P>

      <h3>Fuel</h3>

      When I got the bike, it had a full tank of 87 octane pump gas. The
      bike ran terribly. When hot, it would not idle with two turns on the
      air screw. If I adjusted the air screw such that the bike would idle
      when hot, it would not start cold, and ran very roughly. Starting the
      bike on 87 octane gas was also frustrating, requiring 8 or 10 seconds
      to start.<P>

      After studying the Zongshen and Asiawing manuals, it was clear that I
      should be using higher octane fuel. After draining and refilling the
      tank with 93 octane pump gas and setting the air screw back to two
      turns, the bike starts immediately and runs flawlessly. I didn't
      notice audible pinging with the 87 octane gas, but I did get a lot of
      stuttering above 1/4 throttle, which I don't get with 93.<P>


      <h2>Exhaust</h2>

      The stock exhaust on the NC250 has the appearance of an aftermarket
      pipe, is fairly light (TKTKg), but lacks an internal spark arrestor.<P>

      <h2>Suspension</h2>


      According to Borossi, rear suspension is "rear pergressive FastAce
      Performance mono shock absorber with spring preload and rebound and
      compression damping. I took my rear shock to my local RaceTech
      dealer, <A HREF="https://www.mrpmotorsports.com/">MRP Motorsports</A>,
      and had the factory spring rated. The stock spring is 270mm in length,
      with 58mm and 60mm ID on the top and bottom ends, respectively. The
      rate is 6.1kg/mm.<P>

      I've resprung mine with a 66 N/mm &Ouml;hlins spring (06310-17), which &Ouml;hlins lists as a KYB replacement spring.<P>

      Also according to Borossi, the front suspension is an 47mm Upside-Down
      FastAce Performance fork; rebound and compression adjustable<P>

              You can remove the rear shock fairly easily using <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvkLxjvcwA">this method</a>, which involves removing the pipe and unbolting the subframe, without having to remove the airbox. I recommend loosening the pipe clamp by the carb outlet, and have some (I used zip ties) to support the subframe while the shock is out.<P>
              

              <h2>Handlebars/Risers</h2>
              <A HREF="handlebar.jpg"><IMG SRC="small_handlebar.jpg"></A>
              The stock handle bar is tapered from 1.125" to 0.875" (1 1/8 to 7/8)

              <h2>Shifter</h2>
              <A HREF="shifter.jpg"><IMG SRC="small_shifter.jpg"></A>

              The shifter is of the folding design, similar to the
              CRF250X pattern, but I haven't compared them.

              Length is about 5" from the front edge to the center
              line of the shifter shaft, which I measured as 0.425"
              (10.8mm?). I crudely measured this without detaching the
              shifter. If you are looking for this measurement let me
              know, I'll take it off and get a more accurate measure.
