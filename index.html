<h1>GooseYArd's SSR SR250S/Asiawing NC250 Information Page</h1>
A while back, I bought one of my kids an SSR SR70C dirt bike. I was
so impressed with the little bike that later, when I was looking
for a used 250 to ride with my kids, I decided to take a chance on
SSR's larger machine, the SR250C.
<p><img src="small_bike.jpg"></p>
<p>Information about these bikes is somewhat hard to come by;
despite their low price, and although the pit bikes seem to sell
pretty well, I'm the only person I know who actually owns an
SR250S</p>
<p>I expect to get a lot details wrong on this page and I count on
readers who know more than I do to set me straight. Please, if you
have corrections or additional information for the page, email it
to me at <a href="mailto:gooseyard@gmail.com?Subject=NC250_page"
target="_top">gooseyard@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The NC250 is manufactured by <a href=
"http://asiawing.com/">Shandong Asiawing Motors Co.,Ltd.</a> (their
website appears to be down at the moment I am writing this). It is
distributed to other countries around the world by other importers.
In the United States, the bike is imported by SSR Motorsports and
is known as the SR250S.
<p>In Europe, <a href=
"http://www.borossi.com/Asiawing-Enduro-SuperMoto/">Borossi</a>
distributes the bikes, now under the Asiawing brand.</p>
<p>The SR250S is patterned on the 2007 model year CRF250X. In most
cases, parts for that bike will fit the SR250S.</p>
<h2>Engine</h2>
The NC250/SR250S engine is a <a href=
"http://www.zse.cc/productsdetail.aspx?ProductsCateId=43&amp;ProductsID=386">
Zongshen ZS177MM</a>
<p>This engine is also used in a number of other Chinese
motorcycles and scooters, perhaps most notably the Zongshen RX-3
adventure-touring bike, which is distributed in the United States
by the <a href="http://www.cscmotorcycles.com/">California Scooter
Company</a>.</p>
<h3>ZS177MM Parts</h3>
When searching online for SR250S parts, it is helpful to use
"NC250" rather than "SR250S", since the bike is called NC250
everywhere except the US.
<p>Parts for this motor are plentiful and relatively cheap if you
don't mind having them shipped from abroad.</p>

<p>Another option is to purchase parts from CSC for the RX-3:</p>

<h2>Carburetor</h2>
The NC250 carburetor is manufactured by <a href=
"http://www.sunworld.com.tw/en/main/">Sunworld Moto</a>. Mine has
the marking <i>SWR H34AS4-1514 PHB E34</i>.
<p><a href="carb.jpg"><img src="small_carb.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I sent an inquiry to a representative at Sunworld Moto about the
availability of a jet kit for this carb. Sunworld replied
immediately that this carb is made exclusively for the NC250, and
that my distributor would handle parts for it. I spoke to a
representative at SSR, who informed me that a jet kit for a CRF250X
would fit the SWR carb, but I have yet to try this.</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
From the dealer, the factory setting for the air screw was the
standard 2 turns.
<h3>Fuel</h3>
When I got the bike, it had a full tank of 87 octane pump gas. The
bike ran terribly. When hot, it would not idle with two turns on
the air screw. If I adjusted the air screw such that the bike would
idle when hot, it would not start cold, and ran very roughly.
Starting the bike on 87 octane gas was also frustrating, requiring
8 or 10 seconds to start.
<p>After studying the Zongshen and Asiawing manuals, it was clear
that I should be using higher octane fuel. After draining and
refilling the tank with 93 octane pump gas and setting the air
screw back to two turns, the bike starts immediately and runs
flawlessly. I didn't notice audible pinging with the 87 octane gas,
but I did get a lot of stuttering above 1/4 throttle, which I don't
get with 93.</p>
<h2>Exhaust</h2>
The stock exhaust on the NC250 has the appearance of an aftermarket
pipe, is fairly light (TKTKg), but lacks an internal spark
arrestor.
<h2>Suspension</h2>
According to Borossi, rear suspension is "rear pergressive FastAce
Performance mono shock absorber with spring preload and rebound and
compression damping. I took my rear shock to my local RaceTech
dealer, <a href="https://www.mrpmotorsports.com/">MRP
Motorsports</a>, and had the factory spring rated. The stock spring
is 270mm in length, with 58mm and 60mm ID on the top and bottom
ends, respectively. The rate is 6.1kg/mm.
<p>I've resprung mine with a 66 N/mm &Ouml;hlins spring (06310-17),
which &Ouml;hlins lists as a KYB replacement spring.</p>
<p>Also according to Borossi, the front suspension is an 47mm
Upside-Down FastAce Performance fork; rebound and compression
adjustable</p>
<p>You can remove the rear shock fairly easily using <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnvkLxjvcwA">this method</a>,
which involves removing the pipe and unbolting the subframe,
without having to remove the airbox. I recommend loosening the pipe
clamp by the carb outlet, and have some (I used zip ties) to
support the subframe while the shock is out.</p>
<h2>Handlebars/Risers</h2>
<a href="handlebar.jpg"><img src="small_handlebar.jpg"></a>
<p>The stock handle bar is tapered from 1.125" to 0.875" (1 1/8 to
7/8)</p>
<h2>Shifter</h2>
<a href="shifter.jpg"><img src="small_shifter.jpg"></a>
<p>The shifter is of the folding design, similar to the CRF250X
pattern, but I haven't compared them.</p>
<p>Length is about 5" from the front edge to the center line of the
shifter shaft, which I measured as 0.425" (10.8mm?). I crudely
measured this without detaching the shifter. If you are looking for
this measurement let me know, I'll take it off and get a more
accurate measure.</p>
